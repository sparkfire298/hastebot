# Hastebot
Discord bot for uploading text pastes to Hastebin


# Setup
- Download the repository, unzip it and open a terminal in the folder
(VS Code, right click on the folder and click Open with Code)
- Run `npm install discord.js@13 hastebin.js`
- Go to the bottom line and put a token in `bot.login()` (Like bot.login("Token")
- Start the bot with `node index.js` (Or whatever you renamed the file to)


# Disclaimers
- This is not intended for self-hosting, and the original can be found [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=964106323153285160&permissions=18432&scope=bot) (I will not help you with any issues you may encounter with a self-hosted version)
- This bot is not for online editors (replit, glitch, etc) and you will need to secure your token yourself (contrary to the above notice)
- This bot isn't designed to work with Discord.js V14 and I will not adjust it for you (Make sure to add `@13` at the end when installing it)
